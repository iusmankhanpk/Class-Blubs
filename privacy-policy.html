          <h3>B. Standard Booking Term and Conditions (between Education Partner and Customer)
          </h3>

          <p>1. Any Listing by the Education Parner, which can be booked on the ClassBubs platform constitutes an offer,
            and a fully paid up booking constitutes acceptance of that offer. The booking is a direct agreement between
            the Education Partner and the Customer, and ThinkKids EdTech Pte Ltd is not a party.

            2. By making a reservation or booking on ClassBubs, you enter into a direct and legally binding relationship
            with the Education Partner with which you have reserved or booked from. ClassBubs acts solely as an
            intermediary between you and the Education Partner, transmitting the details of the reservation or booking,
            sending confirmatory emails on behalf of the Education Partner in some cases, processing payment and
            carrying out other incidental tasks to process the transaction. All reservations and/ or bookings are
            subject to the Standard Booking Term and Conditions (between Education Partner and Customer). In addition,
            the Education Partner may have further terms and conditions which they will upload to the website. You are
            advised to read these in detail before making your booking.

            3. By making the booking, you are bound by the Education Partner's terms of cancellation, re-scheduling and
            refund policy. In the absence of any specific terms by the Education Partner, there shall be no refund given
            by the Education Partner, or rescheduling allowed, in any circumstances. Where rescheduling is allowed by
            the Education Partner's terms, ClassBubs is able to support such rescheduling. In any event, any refund
            shall be a matter for you and the Education Partner to resolve directly, and ClassBubs shall not be liable
            for any refund.

            4. When you make payment through the ClassBubs system, this payment is safely processed by means of secure
            online payment (all to the extent offered and supported by your bank). ThinkKids EdTech Pte Ltd shall not be
            responsible for withholding tax, or for any tax payment of whatsoever nature which you or the Education
            Partner are legally bound to pay.

            5. By completing a booking or reservation, you agree to receive (a) emails which ClassBubs may send you in
            relation to your booking or reservation, giving you information on your course and providing you with
            certain information and offers (including third party offers to the extent that you have actively opted in
            for this information) relevant to your interests and the Educational Offering you booked or reserved, and
            (ii) emails which we may send to you promptly after you have participated in the Educational Offering,
            inviting you to complete our review form.

            6. The booking is subject to the cancellation policy of the Education Partner providing the Educational
            Offering. In any event, parties agree that any booking fee received by ThinkKids EdTech Pte Ltd is
            non-refundable.

            7. The booking is subject to the rescheduling policy of the Education Partner. The ClassBubs platform will
            support rescheduling but parties agree that ThinkKids EdTech Pte Ltd shall not be liable for any acts or
            omissions relating to such rescheduling support.</p>
